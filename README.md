# IA - Masterclass

This repository contains different implementation of perceptron algorithm and his implementation with layer.
You can find rust and python implementation.
In wich implementation you can find a simple example of how to use it.

- Main file: definition of dataset and layer
- Perceptron file: implementation of perceptron algorithm
- Layer file: implementation of layer

How to use Python implementation:

- install python3
- go in /python folder and run:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

How to use Rust implementation:

- install rust and cargo
- go in /rust folder and run:

```bash
